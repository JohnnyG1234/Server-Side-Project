Good morning, afternoon, evening or whatever time you are looking at this project.

We have gathered all the necessary files that you need.
The frontend folder contains all the html, css, javascript, and php.
The backend folder contains all the mysql database code.

For this project we used wampsever to run the databases and frontend code together. 
Beforehand, please start up wampserver.

First, make sure you unzip the submission folder and place it into your wampserver www folder.
Then, create the databases with the backend files and then insert the data into the databases with the
insert_data files. 

Second, open a web broswer of your choosing. Enter localhost\Server-Side-Project\Frontend\htm folder in the search,
then open the home.html.

From here, explore the pages! Add bikes to the cart, place your order, and you should get a order confirmed page. 
Afterwords, check the database and query to find the data you entered. Customers should have your name, contact, 
and shipping information. Orders should have created a new order with the order data showing how may bikes were ordered.
Payment should have the billing information you entered.

And look! We're done. Wooooooo!
Thanks for watching.
